# PROGRAMMING-FOR-DATA-ANALYTICS-AND-AI
the “Psycological Effects of COVID” dataset from the “Programming for Data Analytics and
AI” module page on Moodle. Your project report should contains the following sections (The grade weight
of each section is specified):
 [10%] Descriptive analytics: use basic statistics (e.g. distribution information of all attributes,
outliers) and at least 4 visualisation graphs (e.g. histograms, scatter plots) to describe the data.
 [20%] Data Preparation: Prepare your data to build your models using at least 3 methods. Your
data should be cleaned using different methods (e.g. handling missing values and outliers,
normalisation, discretisation).
 [35%] Perform classification on the “gender” using at least 3 algorithms, evaluate the models,
compare and discuss the results.
 [15%] Perform regression on the “self_time” attribute using at least 1 algorithms, evaluate the
model, compare and discuss the results.
 [20%] Perform clustering using at least 1 algorithms, compare and discuss the results.
